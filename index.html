            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I am Emily Roberts. I developed this plan for me, and whilst that sounds a bit selfish, I knew I needed
                to change my lifestyle, to be the best version of myself I can be. At the time of writing, I am aged 48
                and heading towards the age of 50. Being brutally honest, prior to this regime, I was not in the best
                shape that I could be. </p><br>

            <p>A country's cuisine they say is to know by means of the recipe; the customs and the richness or poverty
                of a
                place, and the spirit of those who inhabit it. It is, above all, to participate in the symbolic
                celebration
                of the shared repast. Bangladesh- “The country of Bengal” is one of our neighbours, it is the eight
                most populous country and one of the most densely populated countries in the world. And its cuisine
                though
                almost like our own, shows some unique elements which make it special.</p>

            <h2>Balsamic Chicken</h2>
            <h4>Preparation:</h4>
            <ol class="recipies">
                <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the balsamic vinegar with sugar and garlic. Place chicken breasts in the
                    marinade, then, Whisk together to coat well on each side before placing them into the refrigerator
                    for 10 minutes.</li><br>
                <li>In medium-high heat, warm some olive oil. Remove the chicken! Place these pieces into your heated
                    pan, cooking them until they start to brown on each side but not too much, or else it will be raw
                    inside - about 7 minutes per side depending upon how big those breasts are you're using (I recommend
                    flipping mine once). Pour whatever remains of that liquid onto the top, so everything gets nicely
                    coated together with an ultra-rich flavor.</li>

            <h2>Palestinian Sailor's Salad</h2>
            <h4>Preparation:</h4>
            <p>Break apart the toasted bread. Chop chili peppers, removing some of the membranes and seeds. In a mortar
                and pestle, pound the peppers along with the salt until soft. Add the basil and muddle to extract
                flavor. Add the green onions and crush well, followed by the cucumbers. Finally, stir in the tomatoes
                and mash up. Mix the entire salad to incorporate all ingredients. In a separate bowl, whisk the tahini
                with the lemon juice until emulsified. Right before serving, mix the tahini sauce and bread pieces into
                the salad. Transfer to a serving dish and flatten the top. Drizzle the surface generously with a good
                quality olive oil. Garnish with pitted green olives, pickled peppers, and radish slices.</p>
